\begin{itemize}
% \item Lab member of Eagle Lab VIPA(Visual Interaction and Graphics) group (also named ``Microsoft Visual Perception Laboratory of Zhejiang University''), 2010--2012
\item Lab member of Large-scale System Architecture (LSA) Lab, National Tsing Hua University, 2012--Current

    \begin{itemize}
	  % Rewrite in 2013
	  \item Work on ``automated constraint verification for databases'' under the guidance of Prof.V\'eronique Benzaken and Prof. \'Evelyne Contejean.
%	  \item Current research focuses on ``Automated constraints verification for databases''.
	  \item Based on the observation that currently no real database management system (DBMS) have fully support the management of integrity constraints and run-time checking is time-consuming, we have present a compile-time verification strategy based on the weakest precondition and predicate transformer approaches.
%		a strategy to verify the integrity constraints of databases at compile-time. 
%		Our method is based on the weakest precondition and predicate transformer approaches. 
		% Commented in 2013
%	  \item With the help of the software verification platform Why3\href{http://why3.lri.fr/}{\tt (http://why3.lri.fr/)}, we implement integrity constraints checking for databases. All the process is fully automatic.

\item Lab member of Microsoft Visual Perception Laboratory of Zhejiang University, 2010--2012
    \begin{itemize}
	% rewrite in 2013	
	  \item Work on ``scene audio recognition of images'' under the supervison of Prof. Mingli Song. 
% details
% We apply Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and matching pursuit (MP) algorithms to extract the features of training images and sounds respectively. Then machine learning approach is used to find the corresponding environmental sounds for a newly-input image.


%    \item Make a project of scene audio recognition of image. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and matching pursuit (MP) algorithms are applied to extract the features of training images and sounds respectively. Then machine learning approach is used to ﬁnd the corresponding environmental sounds for the speciﬁed image.
%	\item  Read papers in the wide area of Speech-driven facial animation, Speech emotion recognition, AED (Audio event detection), Music emotion recognition, Sound localization, Unstructured audio scene recognition and also Image inpainting and Image completion.
